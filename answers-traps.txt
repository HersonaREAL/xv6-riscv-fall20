Which registers contain arguments to functions? For example, which register holds 13 in main's call to printf?
a0 contains the first arguments which is "%d %d\n", is a address of the string.
a1 contains 12 calculated by f(8)+1.And the compiler optimizes for it.
a2 contains 13 which is immdediate.

Where is the call to function f in the assembly code for main? Where is the call to g? (Hint: the compiler may inline functions.)
There is not instruction calling function f,cause the compiler optimizes for the function.

At what address is the function printf located?
0x630

What value is in the register ra just after the jalr to printf in main?
0x38

unsigned int i = 0x00646c72;
printf("H%x Wo%s", 57616, &i);
What is the output?
HE110 Word

for big-endian set unsigned int i = 0x726c6400 and 57616 does not change.

In the following code, what is going to be printed after 'y='? (note: the answer is not a specific value.) Why does this happen?
y depends on what a2 contain when jump to printf
